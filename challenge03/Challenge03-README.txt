Challenge 03 - README

The details for this challenge are written up here: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~semrich/cs302-21/assignments/ch03.html

The solution.cpp file contains the code I wrote to solve the challenge.
The Makefile compiles the solution.cpp, pipes in the input, and then compares it to the correct input.
	If nothing prints after:
		Testing output...
		Testing memory...

Then the solution is an acceptable answer.

Input are the test cases.
